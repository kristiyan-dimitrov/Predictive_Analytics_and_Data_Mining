# Problem 1

## Part 1

The model predicts that:
- user1 will like doc16 the most with a score of 6
- user2 will like doc2 & doc17 the most (both are tied with score of 10)

The model predicts that user2 will dislike 4 items (docs: 1 9 12 16 have negative scores)

## Part 2

The predictions for user 2 for doc7 and doc 19 are confirmed: 0.7444 & 0.4834 respectively.

In the new model, for user1, the second recommendation is doc6 with a score of 1.3709.
